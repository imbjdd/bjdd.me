# Locked in my home

## Daily log

- Started to learn lambda-calculus
- Took a quick look at measure theory
- Did some exercises on function sequences and series

## Notes
For lambda-calculus, I've read Yves Bertot's course entitled [_Introduction au lambda-calcul pur_](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Yves.Bertot/courses/lambda-pur.pdf), which is very well structured and understandable.

As measure theory is closely related to topology, I was able to quickly immerse myself in the concepts of measure theory.

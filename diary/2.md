## Notes
I totally shaved my hair. Why did I do it? I don't know why. I wanted a change. Long hair takes time to maintain. I don't particularly want to look good. I can shave myself every month with the clippers in 10 minutes maximum, which is a huge time-saver. I wanted to keep it simple.

In the same way, I removed a lot of elements from my website. They didn't serve any purpose and accessibility wasn't good.
Just keep it simple.
